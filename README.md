-------------------- how to use this block_chain ---------------

This code was written with python 3. Ensure Python 3 is installed and working. 
Then the steps for all environments will be the same.


This code was written so that no user manual is needed. All instruction will be clear within the app while its running.
The only necessary file is 'block_chain.py'.

To run the app, on a terminal in the folder that contains block_chain.py, run 'python3 block_chain.py'.
The user will be prompted with the main menu where further instructions can be displayed by typing 'help'

Code in block_chain.py was written using a number of sources as a rough guide:
